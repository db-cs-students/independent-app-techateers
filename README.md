## Intent of the app.
This app was made to make it easier on teachers to have more engagement in the classroom.
We have implimented in something that is sort of like quizlet or kahoot. It is used as a guide to help us with our format on our games and type of tests we should make. 

### How to use the app.
In the beginning it will load you onto a login screen to and you have to type in your info to log on.  It will then bring you to the Home page and you will be able to go to the game screen or edit your classes.
You will need to create a class or multiple depending on how many you have.  Then it will load you a leaderboard with everyones name and points.  Once you start making the tests and they use them they will gain points and move farther up.
You can also go to a create game screen so that you can make you own tests and quizes.  This helps you put in your stuff for your class so they can learn it.
